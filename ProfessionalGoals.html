        <h2>Academics</h2>
        <p>
          I came into Madison as a Mechanical Engineering major due to my love for problem solving. Very quickly, I realized that my interest lied within the intersection of Business, Economics, and Technology. This led me to becoming an Economics and Information Science Major in which I have been successful.
